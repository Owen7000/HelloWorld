# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to our project, great, we'd love to have you on board!
To contribute to the project all you have to do is:

1. Write your hello world program in a language of your choice
2. Check to ensure that it has not already been done by going [here](https://github.com/Owen7000/HelloWorld/blob/main/README.md#list-of-current-languages)
3. If your language has not already been done, create a pull request with your code. 
> __Note__ (There is a template for pull requests avaliable [here](.github/pull_request_template.md)
5. Sit back and wait until someone gets back to you!

Have fun, be kind, and always remember, it's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature!
